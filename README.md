<h1>SKOOVA</h1>

<h3>This is the demo app made as part of the alpha hack week 5/08/24</h3>
<p>Made by @matthewkandiah-sonocent, @Ed-Barnes937, @jossglean & @KellyK-Glean</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
- Run `yarn install` from project root
- Run `yarn dev` from project root

<h2>Adding components</h2>
This app uses shadcn-ui to quickly scaffold accessible components using Radix-UI & Tailwind under the hood. Use the `shadcn-ui@latest add <>` cli helper to add functions
- `run npx shadcn-ui@latest add button` from project root
- If the cli creates a new directory to put the component files in, simply copy them over to `src/components/ui` before importing them to your project
